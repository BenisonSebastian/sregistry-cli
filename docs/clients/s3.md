# Singularity Global Client: Amazon S3

This is the client for interacting with Amazon S3, or a similar storage service. If you are interested
in their container registry, then see [Amazon ECR]({{ site.baseurl }}/client-aws).

If you have an Amazon account with s3, great! If not, then you should jump down
to the [development](#development) section to see how to run a local server to
test with. If you want to jump into Usage, continue reading below.


# Usage

Before starting the client, you will want to export your s3 base URL. For example,
here is how I would do that using the s3 endpoint provided by a Minio Storage Server:

```bash
export SREGISTRY_S3_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

If you are using Amazon AWS S3, leave this undefined. Either way, 
if you have preference for a bucket, export it here too.

```bash
export SREGISTRY_S3_BUCKET=mybucket
```

If you don't do this, it will default to creating (or using an existing) bucket
prefixed with sregistry and a random "Robot Generator" name and number. You'll
also need to export your AWS Credentials and the endpoint you intend to use 
(here is the example with Minio)

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
SREGISTRY_S3_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:9000
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY SREGISTRY_S3_BASE
```

If you don't export these values, you would get an error. Here is an example
of starting a shell with the client, and missing a variable.

```bash
$ sregistry shell s3
ERROR You must export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
```

To set s3 as your session backend, you can export the environment variable:

```bash
export SREGISTRY_CLIENT=s3
```

or for a more permanent default, set it like this:

```bash
$ sregistry backend activate s3
[activate] s3
```

## Push

Once you have exported the variables above, the first thing you likely want to
do is push a container to your registry. If you haven't activated the s3 backend,
you could do either of the following:

```bash
$ SREGISTRY_CLIENT=s3 sregistry push --name vanessa/pusheena:pancake /home/vanessa/Desktop/ubuntu.simg
$ sregistry push --name s3://vanessa/pusheena:tacos /home/vanessa/Desktop/ubuntu.simg
```

If you have set a default, then you don't need to specify s3 either by environment or prefix
of the name:

```bash
$ sregistry push --name vanessa/pusheena:icecream /home/vanessa/Desktop/ubuntu.simg
```

Once you've pushed, you can refresh the interface to see your containers.

## Search

Great, we've pushed some images! Now without the interface, how do we remember
that they are there?


```bash
$ sregistry search vanessa/pancakes
[client|s3] [database|sqlite:////home/vanessa/.singularity/sregistry.db]
[bucket:s3://s3.Bucket(name='sregistry-cowy-arm-5880')]
Containers vanessa
1  vanessa/pancakes:latest.simg	12-21-2018	
2  vanessa/pusheena:icecream.simg	12-21-2018	26MB
3  vanessa/pusheena:meatball.simg	12-21-2018	26MB
4  vanessa/pusheena:pancake.simg	12-21-2018	
5  vanessa/pusheena:tacos.simg	12-21-2018	
```

## Pull

Let's say we want to pull the first image. We can do that easily.

```bash
$ sregistry pull vanessa/pusheena:icecream.simg
$ sregistry pull vanessa/pusheena:icecream.simg
[client|s3] [database|sqlite:////home/vanessa/.singularity/sregistry.db]
[bucket:s3://s3.Bucket(name='sregistry-cowy-arm-5880')]
[container][new] vanessa/pusheena-icecream
Success! /home/vanessa/.singularity/shub/vanessa-pusheena-icecream.simg
```

### Shell

All of the actions above are also available from a shell!

```bash
$ sregistry shell s3
client.push('/home/vanessa/Desktop/ubuntu.simg', name='vanessa/pancakes')
```


# Development

We are going to be using the [Minio Server](https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-docker-quickstart-guide)
as our storage that is akin to S3. Thankfully, we can run it easily with Docker!

```bash
docker run -p 9000:9000 -e MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minio -e MINIO_SECRET_KEY=minio123 minio/minio server /data
```

It will literally spit out some lovely notes about where to find it:

```bash

Endpoint:  http://172.17.0.2:9000  http://127.0.0.1:9000

Browser Access:
   http://172.17.0.2:9000  http://127.0.0.1:9000

Object API (Amazon S3 compatible):
   Go:         https://docs.minio.io/docs/golang-client-quickstart-guide
   Java:       https://docs.minio.io/docs/java-client-quickstart-guide
   Python:     https://docs.minio.io/docs/python-client-quickstart-guide
   JavaScript: https://docs.minio.io/docs/javascript-client-quickstart-guide
   .NET:       https://docs.minio.io/docs/dotnet-client-quickstart-guide

```

Let's follow the instructions and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:9000](http://127.0.0.1:9000).
You should see the Minio storage portal. Note that the mapping is from the internal 
[http://172.17.0.2:9000](http://172.17.0.2:9000) to the same port on localhost,
so if you omit this step you should follow the instructions and go there. If you
did the mapping, Minio should be available at both addresses.

See the MINIO_ACCESS_KEY and MINIO_SECRET_KEY that we entered when we ran the container?
Enter them in the portal above! And look at the minio bird, he's adorable.

![img/aws-minio2.png](img/aws-minio2.png)

Then you should be able to see the Minio storage portal. Congratulations you're done!
Now you can go back and interact with it using the sregistry client.

Thanks to [@fenz](https://www.github.com/fenz) in [this issue](https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/issues/160#issuecomment-449146687) for reaching out to suggest this client!

Then you can continue with the tutorial, and use the Minio specific credentials
for the client:

```bash
SREGISTRY_S3_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:9000
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minio
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minio123
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY SREGISTRY_S3_BASE
```

Once you have these exported, you can start using the client! Here is a shell.

```bash
$ sregistry shell s3
Created bucket sregistry-cowy-arm-5880
[client|s3] [database|sqlite:////home/vanessa/.singularity/sregistry.db]
