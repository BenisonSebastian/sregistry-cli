# Singularity Registry Client

Singularity Registry Client is a python client for interaction with a Singularity registry, which means an open source institution registry ("Singularity Registry") or Singularity Hub proper. We currently require Python > version 3 to use various timezone functions. If you are unable to install version 3.0, we provide a [Singularity container](Singularity) for you to use instead. This is the recommended approach as some older versions of Python do not support generation of the timestamp.
