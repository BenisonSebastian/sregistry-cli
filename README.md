# Singularity Registry Client

Hi Friends! Are your containers lonely? Singularity containers thrive in happiness when they are shared. This means that wherever you might have them in these cloudy places, they are easy to find and move around.

Toward this goal, the Singularity Global Client is a python client for interaction with a Singularity registry of some flavor, which means an open source institution registry ("Singularity Registry") or Singularity Hub proper, or another cloud service where you might have a container. For older architectures, we provide a [Singularity container](Singularity) for you to use instead.

The library is currently under heavy development, and it will be announced when the beta is ready. Stay tuned!
